Pomshare uses Android's built-in sharing menu to easily upload files to [uguu.se](http://uguu.se), a free temporary filehost. No waiting screens, no logins. 100 MB files stored for 24 hours.

Install it [by downloading the .apk on your phone](https://github.com/Nyubis/Pomfshare/releases) and opening the file, after you make sure [installs from untrusted sources are allowed](http://www.tomsguide.com/faq/id-2326514/download-install-android-apps-unidentified-developer.html).
