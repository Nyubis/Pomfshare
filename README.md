Pomshare uses Android's built-in sharing menu to easily upload files to a variety of image hosts, and provides you with the direct link to the image.

Install it [by downloading the .apk on your phone](https://github.com/Nyubis/Pomfshare/releases) and opening the file, after you make sure [installs from untrusted sources are allowed](http://www.tomsguide.com/faq/id-2326514/download-install-android-apps-unidentified-developer.html).
